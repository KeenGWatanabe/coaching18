This error occurs because Terraform can't determine the structure of your `container_definitions` at plan time. Let me provide a fixed version that uses a static map structure.

### Fixed Configuration:

```hcl
# ... (keep all the previous provider, data, and VPC resources) ...

# --- ECS Cluster & Service ---
module "ecs" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ecs/aws"
  version = "~> 5.0"

  cluster_name = "${local.prefix}-ecs"
  fargate_capacity_providers = {
    FARGATE = {
      default_capacity_provider_strategy = {
        weight = 100
      }
    }
  }

  services = {
    myapp-service = {
      cpu    = 512
      memory = 1024
      # Use a static map structure for container_definitions
      container_definitions = {
        "container1" = {
          essential = true
          image     = "${aws_ecr_repository.app.repository_url}:latest"
          port_mappings = [
            {
              containerPort = 8080
              hostPort      = 8080
              protocol     = "tcp"
            }
          ]
          # Add required fields
          name      = "myapp-container"
          cpu       = 512
          memory    = 1024
          # Important: Add these dummy entries to prevent unknown values
          environment = []
          secrets     = []
        }
      }
      assign_public_ip                   = true
      deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 100
      subnet_ids                         = aws_subnet.public[*].id
      security_group_ids                 = [aws_security_group.ecs.id]
      # Add these required fields
      enable_execute_command = true
      task_exec_iam_role_arn = aws_iam_role.ecs_exec_role.arn
    }
  }
}

# --- IAM Role for ECS Exec ---
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_exec_role" {
  name = "${local.prefix}-ecs-exec-role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ecs_exec_policy" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.ecs_exec_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy"
}

# ... (keep the outputs) ...
```

### Key Fixes:

1. **Static Container Definitions**:
   - Used a fixed key ("container1") instead of dynamic references
   - Added all required container definition fields

2. **Added Required IAM Role**:
   - ECS needs an execution IAM role
   - Created `aws_iam_role` resource with proper permissions

3. **Added Missing Fields**:
   - `enable_execute_command` and `task_exec_iam_role_arn` in service definition
   - Required container fields like `name`, `cpu`, `memory`

### Why This Works:
- The error occurred because Terraform couldn't predict the structure of your container definitions
- By using static keys and providing all required fields, we remove the uncertainty
- The IAM role is necessary for Fargate tasks to pull images and execute commands

Try applying this configuration - it should resolve the `for_each` error while maintaining all your original functionality. The service will still be able to pull your ECR image and deploy to your VPC.

# quick fix terraform CLI
# First, initialize Terraform (only needed once)
terraform init

# Step 1: Apply ONLY the dependencies of the for_each (e.g., ECR repository)
terraform apply -target=aws_ecr_repository.app -auto-approve

# Step 2: Now apply the full configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve
